# Data-Quality-and-MDM

Data quality and Master Data Management (MDM) play crucial roles in ensuring the integrity, accuracy, and reliability of organizational information, serving as the bedrock for informed decision-making and efficient business operations.

Data quality refers to the overall health and reliability of data. In today's data-driven landscape, organizations amass vast volumes of information from diverse sources. However, the value of this data is contingent on its quality. Poor data quality can lead to erroneous insights, operational inefficiencies, and misguided strategic decisions. Issues such as inaccuracies, incompleteness, inconsistency, and outdated information can compromise the effectiveness of processes across departments. Therefore, data quality initiatives focus on maintaining high standards by implementing processes for data cleansing, validation, and enrichment.

Complementing data quality, Master Data Management is a comprehensive method for managing and harmonizing critical data, known as master data, throughout an organization. Master data encompasses core entities such as customers, products, employees, and suppliers. MDM involves creating a centralized, authoritative source for this master data, ensuring consistency across systems and applications. By establishing a single version of truth, MDM minimizes data silos and promotes a unified view of information across the enterprise.
